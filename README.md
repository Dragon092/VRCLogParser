# VRCLogParser

This is just a very small application that allows you to search your VRChat log files.

It allows you to copy links to videos that were playing in the ingame video player (like YouTube videos) to save the links. This works for currently playing videos or even after you closed the game.

It can also be helpful to search the log files if you have any issues.
